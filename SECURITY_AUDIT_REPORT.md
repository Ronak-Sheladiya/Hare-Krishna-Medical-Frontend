- **Fix:** Updated CORS configuration to use environment variables properly
- **Files:** `backend/server.js`

### 3. Weak Security Headers (HIGH)

- **Issue:** Basic helmet configuration without CSP
- **Risk:** High - XSS, clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing vulnerabilities
- **Fix:** Enhanced security middleware with comprehensive CSP
- **Files:** `backend/middleware/security.js`

### 4. Insufficient Rate Limiting (MEDIUM)

- **Issue:** Basic rate limiting, no endpoint-specific limits
- **Risk:** Medium - Brute force attacks, API abuse
- **Fix:** Implemented tiered rate limiting per endpoint type
- **Files:** `backend/middleware/security.js`

### 5. Missing Input Sanitization (HIGH)

- **Issue:** No MongoDB injection protection
- **Risk:** High - NoSQL injection attacks
- **Fix:** Added express-mongo-sanitize and enhanced validation
- **Files:** `backend/middleware/security.js`

## Medium Priority Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 6. Sensitive Information Logging (MEDIUM)

- **Issue:** Console.log statements in production code
- **Risk:** Medium - Information disclosure in production logs
- **Fix:** Conditional logging based on environment
- **Files:** `backend/server.js`

### 7. File Upload Security (MEDIUM)

- **Issue:** Basic file validation, no malicious file checks
- **Risk:** Medium - Malicious file uploads, storage abuse
- **Fix:** Enhanced file validation and security checks
- **Files:** `backend/middleware/security.js`

### 8. Missing Security Documentation (LOW)

- **Issue:** No security guidelines or setup documentation
- **Risk:** Low - Poor security awareness, misconfigurations
- **Fix:** Created comprehensive security documentation
- **Files:** `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `backend/SECURITY.md`

## Low Priority Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 9. Incomplete .gitignore (LOW)

- **Issue:** Basic .gitignore missing security-sensitive patterns
- **Risk:** Low - Accidental secret commits
- **Fix:** Enhanced .gitignore with comprehensive security patterns
- **Files:** `.gitignore`

### 10. Missing Dependencies (LOW)

- **Issue:** Security dependencies not installed
- **Risk:** Low - Missing security features
- **Fix:** Created security setup script and documentation
- **Files:** `backend/security-setup.js`

## XSS Vulnerabilities Identified ‚ö†Ô∏è

### dangerouslySetInnerHTML Usage

- **Files:** `src/components/common/OfficialInvoiceDesign.jsx`, `src/components/common/ProfessionalInvoice.jsx`
- **Risk:** High - XSS vulnerability through user-controlled content
- **Status:** IDENTIFIED - Requires careful review of content sanitization
- **Recommendation:** Implement DOMPurify or similar sanitization
