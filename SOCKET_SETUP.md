# ðŸ”„ Real-time Features Setup Guide

The application is currently running with **mock socket client** to prevent build errors. To enable **real-time features**, follow these steps:

## ðŸ“¦ Step 1: Install Socket.io Client

```bash
npm install socket.io-client
```

## ðŸ”§ Step 2: Switch to Real Socket Client

After installing the dependency, update these files:

### Update `src/App.jsx`

```javascript
// Change from:
import socketClient from "./utils/socketClient.simple";

// To:
import socketClient from "./utils/socketClient";
```

### Update `src/hooks/useRealTime.js`

```javascript
// Change from:
import socketClient from "../utils/socketClient.simple";

// To:
import socketClient from "../utils/socketClient";
```

## âš¡ Step 3: Verify Real-time Features
